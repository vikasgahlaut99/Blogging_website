            Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the
            history of rock music.[1] Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary
            of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured
            before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative
            application of such effects as distortion forever transformed the
            sound of rock and roll. While creating his unique musical voice and
            guitar style, Hendrix synthesized diverse genres, including blues,
            R&B, soul, British rock, American folk music, 1950s rock and roll,
            psychedelic and jazz.
